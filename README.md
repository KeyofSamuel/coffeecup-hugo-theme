# Coffeecup Hugo Theme

This theme is in a usable state.  It still has some rough edges and may be missing a few features.  It was inspired by the Jekyll Minimal Mistakes theme, but was adapted specifically for the use of the author.  In its current state, it may be usable by others but it will likely need some minor changes to better fit the intended purpose.

To make this theme simpler and modification easier, it uses W3.CSS rather than bootstrap, some extra CSS and very little JavaScript.

This README will eventually contain all theme documentation, which is still in progress.  Contact the author with any questions.

# Edit Options

## Color theme
Color theme is set in the *main.css* file using W3.CSS tags but generated by hand rather than using one of the built-in W3.CSS themes.  Theme and color modification can be simply changed in the *main.css* file.

## Fonts
Fonts need to be set in head.html to pull from Google and in main.css to apply them to the site.  The *Lato* font is currently set as default for the entire site.

## Fontawesome
Edit the "fontawesome" link to include personal FA kit.

## Set the Hero
Set the hero heading, subheading, description and hero image from the config.toml
